# Exam 1

## DOMinate those buttons

Disclamer: in this exercise, you are only allowed to use `var`s and you are not allowed to use `let` and `const`.
If you are not able to accomplish this task, then you are failed on this exam.

Create a program in which you have at least 100 buttons.
Whenever you click on a button, the index of that button should pop up in an alert window.

## DOMinate your todos

Disclamer:
Use `let` and `const` in this excercise, do not use `var`s.
Structuring your code is good. Please do so. (separate files for css, html and js.)

 - Create a program in which you have at least 100 buttons.
 - The initial text of the button can be arbitrary, but it has to contain the index of the button. (button_0, button_1, button_2, etc is totally fine.)
 - Buttons can have three states: "To Do", "In Progress" and "Done". Every button's initial state is "To Do".
   - If you click on a button, it should enter the next state. State transitions are the follwing: "To Do" -> "In progress" -> "Done".
   - The background color of the button should have something to do with the state.
 - Always save the state of your program.
   - If it's the first time you open your program in the browser, initialize with at least 100 elements.
   - If you reload your browser, the state of your program has to remain the same
 - There should be a "statistics" button in your program. If you click on them, please `alert` a summary of your todos.
   - Sum the number of todos in "To Do", "In progress" and "Done" states.
   - Do not use loops here.
